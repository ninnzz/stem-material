General Info
===================


Hello! This document will help you kickstart your learning about robotics and programming. You can follow the outline at your own pace so no need to feel intimated.

----------


Requirements
-------------

#### Join Slack
First things first. Please join our slack so you can get updates, ask questions or just chat in general. 
**Slack**: https://stemlpnhs.slack.com

> **Note:**
>
> - Make sure to introduce yourself first and what you want to learn in the `general` channel.
> - Use the channel's accordingly.
> - Please read each channel's description so you know where to ask your question.


#### Register in github

You will need a place to store your codes. The best place is to store it in github.
Once you have an account. Create a new repository where you can store your codes.

Here are some links that you can use as tutorials.
- https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
- https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/

#### Learn C Programming

One of the fundamental things that you need to learn is how to write your code.
You just need to learn the basics syntax and concepts.

Here are some online resources:
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/ <-- *has online compiler*
- https://www.learn-c.org/ <-- *has online compiler*
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq

You need to run your program on a compiler if you want to install it locally, you can check our this link:
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_environment_setup.htm

> **IMPORTANT:**
>
> If you are having a troubles or you need help on anything, USE SLACK to ask me questions related to "programming". 

#### Create account in Arduino.cc and Circuits.io

#####  [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/)
Here you can find several tutorials and information about arduino and how it works.

Still lost? **Watch this.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h1m6R9YW8c

#####  [circuits.io](https://circuits.io/)
Don't have arduiono or any electrical components? NO PROBLEM!

You can start by using circuits.io as a simulator for arduino or any other electronic projects. Check this link for some cool tutorials. https://circuits.io/lab/learn

Fundamentals
-------------
#### Electrical Components

This should be your topic in the first grading. You will know what are the different electrical components and their underlying concepts.

For more questions, please approach Mrs. Aquino or use the slack channel to communicate.

#### Programming
Before diving in deep, make sure you have atleast read the C tutorials above. 

Here are the key concepts you need to learn.
- Variables
- Functions
- Operations
	- Arithmetic operations
	- Conditions
- Control structures
	- IF statements
	- For Loops, While loops, etc
